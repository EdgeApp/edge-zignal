# Zignal

A bridge service for Edge Support to bridge messages in Signal to Zendesk.

It has two main scripts:
- `main.py` â€” takes Signal messages and puts them in Zendesk
- `webhook.py` â€” takes Zendesk replies and sends back through Signal

---

## Setup

Install the necessary environment dependencies:

1. Install Python3
2. Install pip

For Ubuntu, installation script is the following:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

Install the package dependencies:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m venv venv
```

Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and edit `.env` with the appropriate the ENV configuration.

```

```
